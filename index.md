## Wetland Identification Automation

This tool is created to make identification of wetlands in Iowa easier and more efficient. It will identify whether or not a location specific data point is a wetland or not a wetland based on five different digital elevation model (DEM) indices. Those five indices are as follows:
1. Topographic Position Index (TPI)
2. Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
3. Terrain Ruggedness Index (TRI)
4. Slope
5. Fill

Currently, I am using four different locations for both training and testing the data
